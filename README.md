# Microfrontends using Next.js and Module Federation

Hello 👋
This is my attempt to do Microfrontends architecture using Next.js and Module Federation.
As this is suppose to be a simple task I didn't ~~overengineer😄~~ try to show everything I can, instead, as required, I really tried to spend ~30 minutes on it.
As a result I have working infrastracture and simple game (shell) which consumes 2 microfrontends.

### How to Run setup

Obviously you can run each application separately, but for your convinience 2 additional scripts are provided:

1. Install all dependencies:

```sh
npm run install:allDeps
```

2. Run all applications:

```sh
npm run start:allApps
```

3. You can find a game running on ➡️ http://localhost:3333/
